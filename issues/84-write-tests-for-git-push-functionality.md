# Issue 84: Write Tests for Git Push Functionality

## Title
Write Tests for Git Push Functionality

## Description
Create comprehensive test coverage for all git push functionality, including unit tests for utility functions, integration tests for the push workflow, and tests for CLI commands and configuration.

## Tasks
- [ ] Write unit tests for checkGitRemote() function
- [ ] Write unit tests for getCurrentBranch() function
- [ ] Write unit tests for hasUpstreamBranch() function
- [ ] Write unit tests for pushToRemote() function
- [ ] Write unit tests for validateRemoteForPush() function
- [ ] Write tests for ConfigManager auto-push methods
- [ ] Write integration tests for AutonomousAgent push flow
- [ ] Write tests for CLI push flags functionality
- [ ] Create mock test utilities for git operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All git utility functions have >90% test coverage
- [ ] Tests cover both success and failure scenarios
- [ ] Mock git commands properly to avoid real git operations
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end push workflow
- [ ] CLI tests verify flag handling and conflicts
- [ ] Tests use Vitest framework consistently

## Additional Context
Tests should use the existing test patterns and utilities. Mock all external git commands to ensure tests don't require actual git repositories or network access. Focus on testing the logic and error handling rather than actual git operations.
