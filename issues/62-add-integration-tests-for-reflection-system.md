# Issue 62: Add integration tests for reflection system

## Requirement
Create integration tests that verify the reflection system works correctly with other components, including file operations, provider interactions, and the bootstrap process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test full reflection cycle with real specs
- [ ] Test multiple iteration scenarios
- [ ] Test file system operations (backup, modify, rollback)
- [ ] Test provider compatibility (Claude and Gemini)
- [ ] Test configuration integration
- [ ] Test CLI option processing
- [ ] Test error recovery and fallback behavior
- [ ] Verify improvement application results

## Technical Details
- Test with sample specification files
- Mock provider responses for consistency
- Verify file modifications are correct
- Test configuration precedence
- Use temporary directories for file operations

## Dependencies
- Issue 58: Integrate reflection with bootstrap process
- Issue 59: Add CLI options for reflection control
- Issue 60: Implement improvement application logic
