# Issue 13: Fix Test Artifacts Generation and Upload

## Description
This issue addresses the problem with test artifact generation in the CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Actions cannot find the expected test coverage reports and test results, preventing proper artifact upload and Codecov integration.

## Requirements
Fix the test artifact generation to ensure coverage reports and test results are properly created and uploaded in the CI/CD pipeline. Currently, GitHub Actions cannot find the expected test artifacts.

## Current State
- **Warning**: "No files were found with the provided path: coverage/ test-results/"
- **Impact**: Cannot upload test results to GitHub, cannot upload coverage to Codecov
- **Affected**: All test jobs in GitHub workflows

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated in the expected location
- [ ] Test results are created and accessible
- [ ] GitHub Actions successfully uploads test artifacts
- [ ] Codecov receives and processes coverage reports
- [ ] No warnings about missing artifact files in CI/CD logs

## Technical Details
### Expected Artifacts
- Coverage reports in `coverage/` directory
- Test results in `test-results/` directory
- Format compatible with Codecov upload

### Current Configuration
- Using Vitest for testing
- GitHub workflow expects artifacts at specific paths
- Codecov integration configured but failing

## Priority
**P1 - High**: This affects visibility into test execution and code coverage

## Dependencies
- Vitest test runner configuration
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Codecov integration settings

## Testing Requirements
- Run `npm test` locally and verify artifact generation
- Check that coverage/ directory is created
- Ensure test-results/ directory contains output
- Verify GitHub Actions can find and upload artifacts
- Confirm Codecov successfully receives coverage data

## Resources
- Vitest configuration: `vitest.config.ts`
- GitHub workflow: `.github/workflows/test.yml`
