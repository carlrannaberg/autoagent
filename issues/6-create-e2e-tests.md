# Issue 6: Create E2E Test Infrastructure

## Description
Set up end-to-end test infrastructure to test the complete CLI workflow from user perspective.

## Requirements

Set up end-to-end test infrastructure to test the complete CLI workflow from user perspective.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] E2E tests run with separate command `npm run test:e2e`
- [ ] CLI binary is tested with real command-line invocations
- [ ] Test coverage includes all major CLI commands (run, complete, validate, etc.)
- [ ] Output validation confirms correct formatting and content
- [ ] Tests pass consistently without flakiness

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Create test/e2e directory structure
- [ ] Implement full CLI workflow tests
- [ ] Test all CLI commands end-to-end
- [ ] Test interactive and non-interactive modes
- [ ] Verify output formatting
- [ ] Test error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add E2E test documentation

## Technical Details
- Use separate Vitest configuration with longer timeouts
- Test actual CLI binary execution
- Verify file system changes
- Test real git operations
- Capture and validate CLI output

## Dependencies
- **Issue 4**: Core functionality must be working
- **Issue 5**: Integration tests should be complete

## Resources
- Master Plan: ./specs/vitest-migration.md (Step 8)
- CLI command documentation
