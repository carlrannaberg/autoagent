# Issue 76: Write tests for git no-verify functionality

## Description
Create comprehensive test coverage for the git no-verify functionality across all components. This includes unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for component interactions, and end-to-end tests to verify the complete feature works as expected in real-world scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement
Write comprehensive tests for all git no-verify functionality including unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for git utility `createCommit` with noVerify option
- [ ] Unit tests for ConfigManager getter/setter methods
- [ ] Unit tests for AutonomousAgent configuration precedence
- [ ] Integration tests for CLI flag handling
- [ ] Integration tests for configuration commands
- [ ] E2E tests demonstrating hook bypass functionality
- [ ] All tests pass and maintain >80% coverage

## Technical Details
This issue ensures comprehensive test coverage for the git no-verify feature across all components.

### Test Categories:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Git utility flag handling
   - Configuration management
   - Agent precedence logic

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - CLI command execution
   - Configuration persistence
   - Flag conflict resolution

3. **E2E Tests**:
   - Full workflow with hooks
   - Hook bypass verification
   - Configuration scenarios

## Dependencies
- Issues 70-75: All implementation work must be completed

## Testing Requirements
- Follow existing test patterns
- Use Vitest framework
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error scenarios
- Verify edge cases

## Resources
- Master Plan: `./specs/git-commit-no-verify-configuration.md`
- Test examples from specification
