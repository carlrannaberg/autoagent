# Issue 7: Add Benchmark Tests

## Requirement
Implement performance benchmark tests to measure and track execution performance over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create benchmark test structure
- [ ] Implement execution performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add provider initialization benchmarks
- [ ] Create batch processing benchmarks
- [ ] Add memory usage benchmarks
- [ ] Set up benchmark reporting
- [ ] Document benchmark baselines

## Technical Details
- Use Vitest's bench functionality
- Measure critical path performance
- Track memory usage patterns
- Compare provider performance
- Establish performance baselines

## Dependencies
- Issue #3: Test utilities must be available
- Issue #4: Core tests should be migrated

## Resources
- Master Plan: ./specs/vitest-migration.md (Step 9)
- Performance requirements documentation
