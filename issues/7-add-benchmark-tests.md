# Issue 7: Add Benchmark Tests

## Description
Implement performance benchmark tests to measure and track execution performance over time.

## Requirements

Implement performance benchmark tests to measure and track execution performance over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Benchmark tests run with separate command `npm run test:bench`
- [ ] Critical operations are measured with sub-millisecond precision
- [ ] Performance baselines are documented for key operations
- [ ] Benchmark results are output in a readable format
- [ ] Memory usage tracking shows no memory leaks over repeated operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Create benchmark test structure
- [ ] Implement execution performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add provider initialization benchmarks
- [ ] Create batch processing benchmarks
- [ ] Add memory usage benchmarks
- [ ] Set up benchmark reporting
- [ ] Document benchmark baselines

## Technical Details
- Use Vitest's bench functionality
- Measure critical path performance
- Track memory usage patterns
- Compare provider performance
- Establish performance baselines

## Dependencies
- **Issue 3**: Test utilities must be available
- **Issue 4**: Core tests should be migrated

## Resources
- Master Plan: ./specs/vitest-migration.md (Step 9)
- Performance requirements documentation
