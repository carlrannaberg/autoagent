# Issue 11: Fix Vitest Benchmark Reporter Configuration

## Description
This issue addresses a critical CI/CD pipeline failure caused by an incorrect Vitest benchmark reporter configuration. The pipeline is attempting to use a non-existent JSON reporter for benchmarks, resulting in build failures on the master branch.

## Requirements
Fix the Vitest benchmark reporter configuration that is causing CI/CD pipeline failures. The current configuration uses `--reporter=json` but Vitest doesn't have a built-in JSON reporter for benchmarks.

## Current State
- **Error**: "Failed to load custom Reporter from json. Error: Cannot find package 'json'"
- **Command**: `npm run bench` â†’ `vitest bench --config vitest.bench.config.ts --reporter=json --outputFile=bench-results.json`
- **Impact**: Performance benchmarks cannot run, blocking all builds on master branch

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance benchmarks run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Benchmark results are generated in a format that can be stored
- [ ] GitHub workflow can process and store benchmark results
- [ ] `npm run bench` command executes without errors
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes the Performance Benchmarks job

## Technical Details
### Current Implementation
- Using Vitest for benchmarks with `vitest.bench.config.ts`
- Attempting to use non-existent JSON reporter
- GitHub workflow expects JSON output for benchmark storage

### Possible Solutions
1. Remove `--reporter=json` and use default reporter
2. Implement a custom JSON reporter for Vitest benchmarks
3. Use a different output format and update the workflow accordingly
4. Install a third-party Vitest reporter that supports JSON output

## Priority
**P0 - Critical**: This is blocking all builds on master branch

## Dependencies
- None

## Testing Requirements
- Run `npm run bench` locally and verify it completes
- Push changes to a branch and verify CI/CD passes
- Ensure benchmark results are properly stored in GitHub

## Resources
- [Vitest Reporters Documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/reporters.html)
- Current benchmark config: `vitest.bench.config.ts`
- GitHub workflow: `.github/workflows/test.yml`
