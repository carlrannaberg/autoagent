# Issue 81: Update AutonomousAgent for Auto-Push Functionality

## Title
Update AutonomousAgent for Auto-Push Functionality

## Description
Integrate auto-push functionality into the AutonomousAgent class, including validation, execution, and error handling for automatic git push operations after successful commits.

## Requirements
- Integrate auto-push functionality into AutonomousAgent class
- Ensure push failures don't break overall execution
- Provide clear progress reporting and error messages

## Tasks
- [ ] Add validateGitForAutoPush() method to validate remote configuration
- [ ] Update validateGitForAutoCommitAndPush() to include push validation
- [ ] Implement performGitPush() method to execute push operations
- [ ] Update performGitCommitAndPush() to handle both commit and push
- [ ] Add push status tracking to ExecutionResult
- [ ] Handle push failures gracefully without failing execution
- [ ] Add debug logging for push operations
- [ ] Update progress reporting for push operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Auto-push only executes after successful auto-commit
- [ ] Remote validation provides clear error messages
- [ ] Push failures don't break the overall execution
- [ ] Progress is reported during push operations
- [ ] Upstream tracking is set automatically when needed
- [ ] Debug mode shows detailed push information

## Additional Context
The implementation should be non-blocking for push failures since network issues or authentication problems shouldn't fail the entire execution. The commit was the primary goal, and push is a convenience feature. Clear error messages should guide users to resolve push issues.

## Related Issues
- Depends on: Issue 78 (git utilities), Issue 79 (interfaces), Issue 80 (config manager)
- Part of git auto-push configuration feature implementation
