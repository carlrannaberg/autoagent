# Issue 58: Integrate reflection with bootstrap process

## Requirement
Modify the existing bootstrap process in AutonomousAgent to incorporate the reflection engine, enabling iterative improvement of decomposed issues and plans.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update `AutonomousAgent.bootstrap()` method to include reflection
- [ ] Add `performReflectiveImprovement` method
- [ ] Integrate reflection configuration checks
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility when reflection is disabled
- [ ] Add proper logging for reflection progress
- [ ] Handle reflection errors gracefully
- [ ] Update bootstrap return value handling

## Technical Details
- Modify `src/core/autonomous-agent.ts`
- Call reflection engine after initial decomposition
- Pass configuration to reflection process
- Preserve existing bootstrap behavior when disabled
- Ensure atomic operations (all or nothing)

## Dependencies
- Issue 54: Create reflection engine core types and interfaces
- Issue 55: Implement reflection configuration support
- Issue 56: Build reflection engine core logic
