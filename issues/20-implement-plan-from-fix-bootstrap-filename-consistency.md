# Issue 20: Implement plan from fix-bootstrap-filename-consistency

## Description
This issue tracks the decomposition and implementation of the fix for bootstrap filename consistency. The goal is to ensure all issue and plan files use consistent naming conventions by centralizing the slug generation logic.

## Requirements
Decompose the plan into individual actionable issues and create corresponding plan files for each issue.

## Success Criteria
- [x] All issues are created and numbered in the issues/ directory
- [x] Each issue has a corresponding plan file in the plans/ directory
- [x] Each issue has clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- [x] Each plan has implementation phases with tasks
- [x] Todo list is created with all issues
- [x] Issues are properly linked in the todo list

## Technical Details
This issue decomposes the plan into individual actionable tasks for implementation.

IMPORTANT: For each issue you create:
1. Create an issue file in issues/ directory named: {number}-{title-slug}.md
2. Create a corresponding plan file in plans/ directory with the SAME name: {number}-{title-slug}.md
3. The plan file should contain implementation phases and tasks
