# Bootstrap: Decompose master-plan.md into Individual Tasks

## Requirement
Read and analyze the master plan document at `master-plan.md` and decompose it into individual, actionable issues that can be executed autonomously.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Read and fully understand the master plan document
- [ ] Create individual issues for each major component or feature
- [ ] Each issue follows the standard format with clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Create corresponding implementation plans for each issue
- [ ] Update todo.md with all new issues in the correct order
- [ ] Ensure dependencies between issues are clearly documented
- [ ] All issues are self-contained and can be executed autonomously

## Technical Details
- Use the standard issue format found in `examples/example-issue.md`
- Use the standard plan format found in `examples/example-plan.md`
- Issue numbers should continue from the current highest number
- File naming should follow the pattern: `[number]-[descriptive-slug].md`
- Each issue should be atomic and focused on a single feature or component

## Resources
- Master Plan: `master-plan.md`
- Issue Template: `examples/example-issue.md`
- Plan Template: `examples/example-plan.md`
- Project Instructions: `CLAUDE.md`

## Bootstrap Instructions
This is a special bootstrap issue. When executed, you should:

1. Read the master plan document carefully
2. Identify all major components, features, and tasks
3. Create a logical sequence of implementation steps
4. For each step, create:
   - An issue file in `issues/` with clear requirements
   - A plan file in `plans/` with implementation details
5. Update `todo.md` with all new issues
6. Ensure the resulting issues can be executed autonomously in sequence

Remember: The goal is to transform a high-level plan into concrete, executable tasks that the autonomous agent can complete one by one.
