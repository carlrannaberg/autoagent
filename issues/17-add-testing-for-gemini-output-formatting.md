# Issue 17: Add Testing for Gemini Output Formatting

## Requirement
Add comprehensive tests for the new Gemini output formatting functionality to ensure it is working as expected and is robust.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests are created for the text line-breaking logic.
- [ ] Unit tests cover various sentence patterns and edge cases (e.g., multiple punctuation, quotes).
- [ ] Integration tests are added to mock Gemini CLI output and verify the formatted output.
- [ ] E2E tests are created to run actual Gemini executions and verify the readability of the output.

## Technical Details
- Tests should be added in the `test/` directory, mirroring the source file structure.
- Unit tests should be located in `test/unit/utils/` for the stream formatter and `test/unit/providers/` for the Gemini provider.
- Integration tests should be in `test/integration/providers/`.
- E2E tests should be in `test/e2e/cli/`.
