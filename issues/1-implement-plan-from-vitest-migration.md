# Issue 1: Implement plan from vitest-migration

## Description
This issue tracks the decomposition and implementation of the Vitest migration plan for the AutoAgent project. The goal is to break down the master migration plan into individual actionable issues and create corresponding plan files for systematic implementation.

## Requirements
Decompose the plan into individual actionable issues and create corresponding plan files for each issue.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Master vitest-migration.md plan has been analyzed and decomposed into 8-10 individual issues
- [ ] Each created issue follows the naming convention: {number}-{title-slug}.md
- [ ] All issues contain required sections: Description, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Details
- [ ] Corresponding plan files are created in plans/ directory with matching names
- [ ] Todo list in TODO.md is updated with all new issues in correct order

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All issues are created and numbered in the issues/ directory
- [ ] Each issue has a corresponding plan file in the plans/ directory
- [ ] Each issue has clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Each plan has implementation phases with tasks
- [ ] Todo list is created with all issues
- [ ] Issues are properly linked in the todo list

## Technical Details
This issue decomposes the plan into individual actionable tasks for implementation.

IMPORTANT: For each issue you create:
1. Create an issue file in issues/ directory named: {number}-{title-slug}.md
2. Create a corresponding plan file in plans/ directory with the SAME name: {number}-{title-slug}.md
3. The plan file should contain implementation phases and tasks
