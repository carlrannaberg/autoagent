# Issue 5: Create Integration Test Infrastructure

## Description
Set up integration test infrastructure and create comprehensive integration tests for provider failover and core workflows. This ensures the system works correctly in real-world scenarios.

## Requirements
Set up integration test infrastructure and create comprehensive integration tests for provider failover and core workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration tests run with separate command `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Provider failover tests demonstrate automatic switching between providers
- [ ] Core workflow tests cover complete task execution from start to finish
- [ ] All integration tests use real file system operations (not mocked)
- [ ] Test execution time is under 30 seconds for the full integration suite

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Create test/integration directory structure
- [ ] Implement provider failover integration tests
- [ ] Create workflow integration tests
- [ ] Test multi-provider scenarios
- [ ] Test error recovery scenarios
- [ ] Ensure proper test isolation
- [ ] Add integration test documentation

## Technical Details
- Use separate Vitest configuration for integration tests
- Implement realistic provider behavior scenarios
- Test actual file system interactions
- Verify git integration workflows

## Dependencies
- **Issue 3**: Test utilities must be available
- **Issue 4**: Unit tests should be migrated first

## Resources
- Master Plan: ./specs/vitest-migration.md (Step 7)
- Provider failover requirements
