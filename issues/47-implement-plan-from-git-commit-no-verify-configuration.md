# Issue 47: Implement plan from git-commit-no-verify-configuration

## Description
Decompose the git-commit-no-verify-configuration plan into individual actionable issues. This implements configurable git pre-commit hook behavior, allowing users to skip git hooks when needed.

## Requirements
Decompose the plan into individual actionable issues and create corresponding plan files for each issue.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All issues are created and numbered in the issues/ directory
- [ ] Each issue has a corresponding plan file in the plans/ directory
- [ ] Each issue has clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Each plan has implementation phases with tasks
- [ ] Todo list is created with all issues
- [ ] Issues are properly linked in the todo list

## Technical Details
This issue decomposes the plan into individual actionable tasks for implementation.

IMPORTANT: For each issue you create:
1. Create an issue file in issues/ directory named: {number}-{title-slug}.md
2. Create a corresponding plan file in plans/ directory with the SAME name: {number}-{title-slug}.md
3. The plan file should contain implementation phases and tasks

## Resources
- Master Plan: `./specs/git-commit-no-verify-configuration.md`
