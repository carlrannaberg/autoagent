## [$NEW_VERSION] - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

### Fixed
- Update issue validation to use 'Acceptance Criteria' section  
- Update test fixtures and templates to use Acceptance Criteria
- Make rate limiter test more robust to timing variations

### Added
- Smart diff handling to prevent context window overflow

### Changed
- Optimize release script by pre-computing data for Claude
- Filter out docs/planning files from release diff analysis

Then run: npm version $RELEASE_TYPE --no-git-tag-version
Then commit with: git commit -m \"chore: prepare for v$NEW_VERSION release\"
