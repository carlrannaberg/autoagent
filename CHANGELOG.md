## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Remove `init` command and `.autoagent.json` marker file - projects now use lazy initialization
- Migrate ESLint configuration from legacy `.eslintrc.js` to flat config format (`eslint.config.js`) for ESLint v9 compatibility
- Update npm lint scripts to remove deprecated `--ext` flag
- Update Dependabot configuration to implement conservative update strategy for major versions
- Configure Dependabot to group minor and patch updates for easier testing
- Add version constraints for ESLint v9+ to prevent automatic breaking updates

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove `autoagent init` command - no longer needed as directories are created on-demand
- **BREAKING**: Remove `.autoagent.json` project marker file - configuration is now handled entirely through `.autoagent/config.json`

### Fixed
- Fix Vitest benchmark reporter configuration - Remove invalid `--reporter=json` flag from npm script
- Fix benchmark include path in vitest.bench.config.ts to match actual file locations
- Fix benchmark JSON output configuration to use outputJson option instead of CLI flag
- Fix test artifacts generation for GitHub Actions - Configure Vitest to output coverage reports and test results to expected locations
- Add coverage flag to test:unit and test:integration scripts to ensure coverage is generated in CI
- Configure test result reporters (json, junit) to output to test-results directory for artifact upload
