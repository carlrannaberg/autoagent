# Plan for Issue #37: Add Bootstrap TODO Integration Tests

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/37-add-bootstrap-integration-tests.md`.

## Overview

This plan implements end-to-end integration tests for the bootstrap command's TODO preservation functionality. The tests will verify that the complete bootstrap workflow properly maintains existing TODO content while adding new issues through CLI execution.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up integration test utilities
- [ ] Create workspace setup for integration tests
- [ ] Add CLI execution helpers

### Phase 2: Workflow Tests
- [ ] Test: Complete bootstrap workflow with existing issues
- [ ] Test: CLI command execution and output validation
- [ ] Test: File creation verification (issue and plan)
- [ ] Test: TODO.md content preservation in full workflow

### Phase 3: Edge Case Integration
- [ ] Test: Bootstrap with various project states
- [ ] Test: Error handling in CLI context
- [ ] Test: Bootstrap with permission issues
- [ ] Test: Bootstrap with missing master plan

### Phase 4: Regression Tests
- [ ] Test: Empty project bootstrap still works
- [ ] Test: Bootstrap doesn't break existing workflows
- [ ] Test: Multiple bootstrap operations
- [ ] Test: Bootstrap with concurrent operations

## Technical Approach
Create end-to-end tests that exercise the complete bootstrap command through the CLI interface, verifying the entire workflow functions correctly.

## Potential Challenges
- Simulating realistic CLI execution
- Managing test workspace state
- Handling async operations in tests

## Testing Strategy
- Integration tests using actual CLI execution
- Verification of all created artifacts
- State validation before and after bootstrap
