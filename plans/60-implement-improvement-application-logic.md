# Plan for Issue 60: Implement improvement application logic

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/60-implement-improvement-application-logic.md`.

## Overview

This plan covers implementing the logic to apply validated improvements from the reflection engine to issues and plans. The implementation will safely update files while maintaining data integrity.

## Implementation Steps



### Phase 1: Application Setup
- [ ] Create improvement application module
- [ ] Import file system utilities
- [ ] Set up backup directory structure
- [ ] Define application functions

### Phase 2: Backup System
- [ ] Implement file backup before changes
- [ ] Create timestamped backup directory
- [ ] Copy all affected files
- [ ] Add backup cleanup logic

### Phase 3: Change Handlers
- [ ] Implement ADD_ISSUE handler
- [ ] Implement MODIFY_ISSUE handler
- [ ] Implement ADD_PLAN handler
- [ ] Implement MODIFY_PLAN handler
- [ ] Implement ADD_DEPENDENCY handler

### Phase 4: File Operations
- [ ] Parse existing markdown files
- [ ] Apply modifications safely
- [ ] Preserve file formatting
- [ ] Update cross-references
- [ ] Write updated files

### Phase 5: Transaction Control
- [ ] Implement atomic operations
- [ ] Add rollback mechanism
- [ ] Validate all changes first
- [ ] Apply all or rollback
- [ ] Clean up on success

## Technical Approach
- Use transactional pattern
- Validate before applying
- Maintain file integrity
- Comprehensive error handling

## Potential Challenges
- Parsing varied markdown formats
- Maintaining issue number consistency
- Handling concurrent modifications
