# Plan for Issue 61: Add unit tests for reflection engine

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/61-add-unit-tests-for-reflection-engine.md`.

## Overview

This plan covers creating comprehensive unit tests for the reflection engine, including tests for skip logic, iteration control, prompt building, and improvement analysis.

## Implementation Steps



### Phase 1: Test Setup
- [ ] Create test files for reflection modules
- [ ] Set up test fixtures and mocks
- [ ] Configure test helpers
- [ ] Import modules to test

### Phase 2: Configuration Tests
- [ ] Test default configuration values
- [ ] Test configuration validation
- [ ] Test invalid configuration handling
- [ ] Test configuration merging

### Phase 3: Engine Logic Tests
- [ ] Test shouldSkipReflection conditions
- [ ] Test reflection iteration logic
- [ ] Test early termination conditions
- [ ] Test improvement score thresholds

### Phase 4: Analyzer Tests
- [ ] Test change validation
- [ ] Test scoring algorithms
- [ ] Test dependency detection
- [ ] Test conflict resolution

### Phase 5: Integration Tests
- [ ] Test prompt building
- [ ] Test response parsing
- [ ] Test error recovery
- [ ] Test async operations

## Technical Approach
- Follow Vitest conventions
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure paths

## Potential Challenges
- Mocking provider responses
- Testing async iteration loops
- Simulating various error conditions
