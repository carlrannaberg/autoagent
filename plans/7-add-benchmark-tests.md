# Plan for Issue 7: Add Benchmark Tests

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/7-add-benchmark-tests.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Benchmark Infrastructure
- [ ] Create test/benchmarks directory
- [ ] Configure benchmark test runner
- [ ] Set up benchmark utilities
- [ ] Create performance baseline file

### Phase 2: Core Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Benchmark single issue execution
- [ ] Benchmark batch execution (5, 10, 20 issues)
- [ ] Benchmark provider initialization
- [ ] Benchmark configuration loading
- [ ] Benchmark file parsing operations

### Phase 3: Provider Benchmarks
- [ ] Compare Claude vs Gemini initialization
- [ ] Benchmark provider switching overhead
- [ ] Measure rate limit handling performance
- [ ] Test concurrent provider operations

### Phase 4: Memory Benchmarks
- [ ] Measure memory usage during execution
- [ ] Track memory growth with batch size
- [ ] Identify memory leak patterns
- [ ] Benchmark cleanup efficiency

### Phase 5: Reporting Setup
- [ ] Create benchmark result formatter
- [ ] Set up baseline comparison
- [ ] Add performance regression detection
- [ ] Create benchmark documentation

## Technical Approach
- Use Vitest bench() function
- Run benchmarks in isolation
- Multiple iterations for accuracy
- Track both time and memory

## Benchmark Metrics
```typescript
bench('operation name', async () => {
  // Operation to measure
}, {
  iterations: 100,
  time: 2000, // max time in ms
  warmup: 10 // warmup iterations
});
```

## Key Performance Indicators
1. **Issue Execution Time**: Time per issue
2. **Batch Throughput**: Issues per second
3. **Memory Per Issue**: MB per issue
4. **Provider Overhead**: Switching time
5. **Startup Time**: CLI initialization

## Potential Challenges
- Benchmark stability across runs
- Environmental variations
- Mock vs real operation timing
- Memory measurement accuracy

## Success Metrics
- All critical paths benchmarked
- Baselines established and documented
- Performance regressions detectable
- Reports generated automatically
