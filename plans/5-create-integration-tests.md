# Plan for Issue #5: Create Integration Test Infrastructure

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/5-create-integration-tests.md`.

## Overview

This plan establishes comprehensive integration testing infrastructure for AutoAgent, focusing on provider failover scenarios, workflow testing, and error recovery. The tests validate real-world usage patterns including multi-provider coordination and graceful degradation.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup Integration Test Structure
- [ ] Create test/integration directory
- [ ] Set up integration test configuration
- [ ] Create shared integration test utilities
- [ ] Configure longer timeouts for integration tests

### Phase 2: Provider Failover Tests
- [ ] Test Claude to Gemini failover on rate limit
- [ ] Test Gemini to Claude failover
- [ ] Test both providers unavailable scenario
- [ ] Test partial execution recovery
- [ ] Test failover with different error types

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete issue lifecycle
- [ ] Test multi-issue batch execution
- [ ] Test configuration management flow
- [ ] Test git integration workflows
- [ ] Test TODO list updates

### Phase 4: Error Recovery Tests
- [ ] Test recovery from network failures
- [ ] Test handling of malformed responses
- [ ] Test timeout scenarios
- [ ] Test filesystem permission errors
- [ ] Test git conflict scenarios

### Phase 5: Performance Tests
- [ ] Test concurrent issue execution
- [ ] Test large issue batch processing
- [ ] Measure provider switching overhead
- [ ] Test memory usage patterns

## Technical Approach
- Use TestWorkspace for consistent setup
- Mock only external providers, not internal components
- Test real file system and git operations
- Use realistic timing and delays

## Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: All providers available, all executions succeed
2. **Rate Limiting**: Primary provider rate limited after N requests
3. **Flaky Providers**: Intermittent failures requiring retries
4. **Degraded Mode**: One provider completely unavailable
5. **Recovery**: Resume after partial execution

## Potential Challenges
- Test execution time management
- Ensuring proper test isolation
- Managing test data cleanup
- Simulating realistic provider behaviors

## Success Metrics
- All critical workflows have integration tests
- Provider failover works reliably
- Tests complete within reasonable time
- Clear documentation of test scenarios
