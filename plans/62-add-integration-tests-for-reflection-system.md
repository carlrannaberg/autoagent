# Plan for Issue 62: Add integration tests for reflection system

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/62-add-integration-tests-for-reflection-system.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Create integration test directory structure
- [ ] Set up temporary directory helpers for file operations
- [ ] Create sample specification files for testing
- [ ] Set up mock provider helpers for consistent responses

### Phase 2: Full Reflection Cycle Tests
- [ ] Test complete spec → bootstrap → reflection → improvement cycle
- [ ] Test with different spec complexities (simple vs complex)
- [ ] Verify file backup and restoration works correctly
- [ ] Test improvement application to actual files

### Phase 3: Multi-Iteration Scenarios
- [ ] Test multiple reflection iterations with improvements
- [ ] Test early termination when improvement threshold is met
- [ ] Test maximum iteration limits
- [ ] Test iteration state tracking and accumulation

### Phase 4: Provider Integration Tests
- [ ] Test reflection with Claude provider
- [ ] Test reflection with Gemini provider
- [ ] Test provider failover during reflection
- [ ] Test provider timeout and error handling

### Phase 5: Configuration Integration Tests
- [ ] Test reflection configuration from command line
- [ ] Test reflection configuration from config files
- [ ] Test configuration precedence and overrides
- [ ] Test disabled reflection scenarios

### Phase 6: Error Recovery and Edge Cases
- [ ] Test malformed provider responses
- [ ] Test file system errors during reflection
- [ ] Test interrupted reflection processes
- [ ] Test rollback scenarios on failures

## Technical Approach

**Test Structure:**
- Use integration test directory with real file operations
- Create isolated temporary workspaces for each test
- Mock provider responses for deterministic testing
- Test actual file modifications and rollbacks

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- End-to-end reflection workflow validation
- Provider switching and failover testing
- Configuration and CLI option processing
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**File Organization:**
- Place tests in `test/integration/reflection/`
- Use descriptive test names for each scenario
- Group related tests by functionality area
- Include setup and cleanup helpers

## Potential Challenges

- Managing temporary directories and cleanup
- Mocking provider responses while maintaining realism
- Testing async operations and timing-dependent behavior
- Ensuring tests are deterministic and don't depend on external state
