## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to addIssueToTodo method
- [ ] Update bootstrap method documentation
- [ ] Document the preservation behavior in code
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic

### Phase 2: User Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md bootstrap section
- [ ] Add examples of bootstrap with existing issues
- [ ] Clarify that bootstrap is safe for active projects
- [ ] Document the append behavior

### Phase 3: CHANGELOG Update
- [ ] Add entry to Unreleased section
- [ ] Categorize as "Fixed" (bug fix)
- [ ] Describe the data loss prevention
- [ ] Reference the issue number

### Phase 4: Migration Guide
- [ ] Document that no migration is needed
- [ ] Explain the behavior change
- [ ] Provide examples of new vs old behavior
- [ ] Address any user concerns

## Technical Approach
Comprehensive documentation update to ensure users understand the new safe bootstrap behavior and developers understand the implementation.

## Potential Challenges
- Explaining the change clearly to users
- Ensuring documentation is discoverable
- Maintaining consistency across docs

## Documentation Strategy
- Clear examples showing the preservation behavior
- Emphasis on safety and data protection
- Simple migration message (no action needed)
