# Plan for Issue #32: Update documentation for filename conventions

## Overview

This plan updates all relevant documentation to explain the filename conventions used by AutoAgent. The documentation will cover the slug generation process, provide clear examples, and ensure users understand how issue and plan files are named consistently.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Code Documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc to generateFileSlug method
- [ ] Document method parameters and return value
- [ ] Include examples in JSDoc
- [ ] Document the transformation rules

### Phase 2: User Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with naming conventions section
- [ ] Add clear examples of filename pairs
- [ ] Explain the slug generation process
- [ ] Document backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Release Documentation
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with this improvement
- [ ] Mark as enhancement in unreleased section
- [ ] Include brief description of the fix
- [ ] Reference the issue numbers

## Technical Approach

### JSDoc Example
```typescript
/**
 * Generates a URL-friendly slug from a title for use in filenames.
 * Converts spaces to hyphens, removes special characters, and normalizes formatting.
 * 
 * @param title - The title to convert to a slug
 * @returns A sanitized slug suitable for filenames
 * 
 * @example
 * generateFileSlug('Implement User Authentication') // 'implement-user-authentication'
 * generateFileSlug('Fix Bug #123') // 'fix-bug-123'
 */
```

## File Naming Conventions

AutoAgent creates consistent filename patterns...
```

## Potential Challenges
- Keeping documentation concise but complete
- Ensuring examples are clear and helpful
- Maintaining consistency across all docs

## Dependencies
- All implementation issues (26-31) should be complete
