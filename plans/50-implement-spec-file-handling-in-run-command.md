# Plan for Issue 50: Implement spec file handling in run command

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/50-implement-spec-file-handling-in-run-command.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Bootstrap Flow
- [ ] Import bootstrap logic dependencies
- [ ] Add spec file handling branch in run command
- [ ] Call agent.bootstrap() with spec file path
- [ ] Capture returned issue number from bootstrap

### Phase 2: Implement Auto-Execution
- [ ] After successful bootstrap, execute decomposition issue
- [ ] Add progress logging for each stage
- [ ] Handle bootstrap failures gracefully
- [ ] Check provider availability before starting

### Phase 3: Add --all Flag Support
- [ ] Check if --all flag is set after decomposition success
- [ ] Call agent.executeAll() when appropriate
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling for multi-issue execution
- [ ] Report final completion status

### Phase 4: User Feedback
- [ ] Add clear messages for bootstrap stage
- [ ] Show decomposition execution progress
- [ ] Indicate when switching to --all execution
- [ ] Summary message with total issues created/executed

## Technical Approach
- Leverage existing Agent methods (bootstrap, executeIssue, executeAll)
- No code duplication - reuse existing implementations
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Follow existing logging conventions

## Testing Strategy
- Integration test for spec file → bootstrap → execute flow
- Test --all flag behavior
- Test error scenarios (invalid spec, bootstrap failure)
- Verify progress messages appear correctly

## Potential Challenges
- Managing state between bootstrap and execution
- Handling interrupts during multi-stage process
- Clear progress indication without overwhelming output
- Ensuring transaction-like behavior (all-or-nothing)

## Additional Notes
This makes the run command truly "smart" by handling the full workflow from spec to implementation. The user experience should feel seamless and intuitive.
