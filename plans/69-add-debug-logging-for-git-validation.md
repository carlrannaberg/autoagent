## Overview

This plan covers adding detailed debug logging for git validation to help users troubleshoot configuration issues.

## Implementation Steps



### Phase 1: Add validation start logging
- [ ] Log when git validation begins

## Technical Approach
- Check config.debug before logging
- Use reportProgress method for consistency
- Include relevant details without being verbose
- Follow existing debug log patterns

## Potential Challenges

- Maintaining performance with logging

## Testing Considerations
- Test logs only appear in debug mode
