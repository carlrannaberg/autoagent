# Plan for Issue 67: Write tests for git validation functionality

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/67-write-tests-for-git-validation-functionality.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit tests for AutonomousAgent
- [ ] Test validateGitForAutoCommit with auto-commit disabled
- [ ] Test validation with git not available
- [ ] Test validation with non-git repository
- [ ] Test validation with missing user config
- [ ] Test successful validation flow
- [ ] Test debug logging output

### Phase 2: Unit tests for git utilities
- [ ] Test validateGitEnvironment with all checks passing
- [ ] Test with git not installed
- [ ] Test with non-git directory
- [ ] Test with missing user configuration
- [ ] Verify result structure and content

### Phase 3: Integration tests
- [ ] Test full execution flow with validation failure
- [ ] Test that AI calls are avoided on validation failure
- [ ] Test error propagation to CLI output
- [ ] Test with real git scenarios

## Technical Approach
- Use Vitest mocking for git commands
- Mock git utility functions appropriately
- Test error message content precisely
- Ensure async operations are handled correctly

## Potential Challenges
- Mocking git command execution properly
- Testing multi-line error messages
- Ensuring tests are deterministic

## Testing Considerations
- Use beforeEach to reset mocks
- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify mock function call counts
