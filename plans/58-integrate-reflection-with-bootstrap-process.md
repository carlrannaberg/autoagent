# Plan for Issue 58: Integrate reflection with bootstrap process

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/58-integrate-reflection-with-bootstrap-process.md`.

## Overview

This plan covers integrating the reflection engine with the bootstrap process to enable iterative improvement of generated issues and plans. The integration will be seamless and maintain backward compatibility.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Bootstrap Analysis
- [ ] Review current bootstrap implementation
- [ ] Identify integration points
- [ ] Plan minimal changes for compatibility
- [ ] Ensure clean separation of concerns

### Phase 2: Method Enhancement
- [ ] Update `bootstrap()` method signature
- [ ] Add reflection configuration check
- [ ] Split into initial bootstrap and reflection phases
- [ ] Maintain return type compatibility

### Phase 3: Reflection Integration
- [ ] Create `performReflectiveImprovement` method
- [ ] Import reflection engine
- [ ] Pass spec file and initial results
- [ ] Handle reflection response

### Phase 4: Error Handling
- [ ] Add try-catch for reflection process
- [ ] Log reflection failures
- [ ] Fall back to initial results on error
- [ ] Ensure bootstrap always completes

### Phase 5: Progress Tracking
- [ ] Add reflection progress logging
- [ ] Update status messages
- [ ] Track iteration progress
- [ ] Report final improvements

## Technical Approach
- Minimal changes to existing code
- Feature flag pattern for reflection
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear logging boundaries

## Potential Challenges
- Maintaining backward compatibility
- Handling partial reflection failures
- State management between iterations
