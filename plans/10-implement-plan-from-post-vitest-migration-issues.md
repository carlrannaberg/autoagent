# Plan for Issue #10: Implement plan from POST-VITEST-MIGRATION-ISSUES

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/1-implement-plan-from-post-vitest-migration-issues.md`.

## Overview

This plan focuses on analyzing and decomposing the master plan from the POST-VITEST-MIGRATION-ISSUES document. The goal is to break down the master plan into actionable, independent issues that can be tracked and implemented systematically. This involves AI-assisted analysis to ensure proper task decomposition and dependency management.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze the master plan document** - Review the POST-VITEST-MIGRATION-ISSUES master plan to understand all required tasks and their relationships
2. **Decompose into independent issues** - Break down the master plan into discrete, actionable issues that can be worked on independently
3. **Create tracking issues** - Generate individual issue files for each decomposed task with clear acceptance criteria
4. **Update todo list** - Add all newly created issues to the project's todo tracking system
5. **Validate issue independence** - Ensure each issue can be completed without blocking on others
6. **Manage dependencies** - Document any dependencies between issues and establish proper ordering
