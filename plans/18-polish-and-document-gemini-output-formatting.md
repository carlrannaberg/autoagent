# Plan for Issue 18: Polish and Document Gemini Output Formatting

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/18-polish-and-document-gemini-output-formatting.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Polish Implementation
- [ ] Handle edge cases (abbreviations, numbers, etc.).
- [ ] Optimize sentence detection regex.

### Phase 2: Documentation
- [ ] Update `README.md` to note the improved Gemini output readability.
- [ ] Update provider documentation to mention the formatted output.
- [ ] Add an entry for this improvement to the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Technical Approach
- Refine the regex to be more robust without adding significant complexity.
- Add a new entry to the "Changed" section of the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Potential Challenges
- The regex for sentence splitting might become overly complex if too many edge cases are handled.
- Ensuring documentation updates are clear and easy to understand.
