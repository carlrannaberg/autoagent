# Plan for Issue #18: Polish and Document Gemini Output Formatting

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/18-polish-and-document-gemini-output-formatting.md`.

## Overview

This plan covers the final polish and documentation phase for the Gemini output formatting feature. The focus is on refining the implementation to handle additional edge cases, optimizing the regex patterns for robustness, and ensuring comprehensive documentation is added to help users understand and benefit from the improved formatting. This phase ensures the feature is production-ready and well-documented.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Refine regex patterns** - Improve sentence detection to handle more edge cases without over-complicating
2. **Handle abbreviations** - Add common abbreviation list to prevent incorrect line breaks
3. **Optimize number handling** - Ensure decimal numbers and dates don't trigger line breaks
4. **Update README** - Document the improved Gemini output readability feature
5. **Update provider docs** - Add details about formatted output to provider documentation
6. **Update CHANGELOG** - Add entry describing the improvement for users
7. **Add usage examples** - Include before/after examples showing formatting improvements
8. **Review and cleanup** - Ensure code is clean, well-commented, and follows project standards

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Polish Implementation
- [ ] Handle edge cases (abbreviations, numbers, etc.).
- [ ] Optimize sentence detection regex.

### Phase 2: Documentation
- [ ] Update `README.md` to note the improved Gemini output readability.
- [ ] Update provider documentation to mention the formatted output.
- [ ] Add an entry for this improvement to the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Technical Approach
- Refine the regex to be more robust without adding significant complexity.
- Add a new entry to the "Changed" section of the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Potential Challenges
- The regex for sentence splitting might become overly complex if too many edge cases are handled.
- Ensuring documentation updates are clear and easy to understand.
