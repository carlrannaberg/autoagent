# Plan for Issue 64: Integrate git validation into executeIssue method

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/64-integrate-git-validation-into-executeissue-method.md`.

## Overview

This plan covers integrating git validation checks into the executeIssue method to validate git environment before execution starts.

## Implementation Steps



### Phase 1: Locate integration point
- [ ] Find executeIssue method in AutonomousAgent class
- [ ] Identify correct location after abort controller initialization
- [ ] Ensure placement is before any AI provider calls

### Phase 2: Add validation call
- [ ] Add await call to validateGitForAutoCommit()
- [ ] Ensure it's within the try-catch block
- [ ] Add progress reporting before validation

### Phase 3: Error handling
- [ ] Ensure validation errors are caught properly
- [ ] Maintain existing error handling patterns
- [ ] Set appropriate execution result on validation failure

## Technical Approach
- Minimal changes to existing code flow
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Early exit on validation failure to save resources

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring validation doesn't break existing workflows
- Proper error propagation and handling
- Maintaining execution state consistency

## Testing Considerations
- Test with auto-commit enabled and disabled
- Verify early exit on validation failure
- Ensure no AI calls when validation fails
