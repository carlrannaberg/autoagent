# Plan for Issue #24: Add Bootstrap Integration Tests

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/24-add-bootstrap-integration-tests.md`.

## Overview

This plan focuses on creating comprehensive integration tests for the bootstrap command that verify its behavior in real-world scenarios. The tests will ensure that bootstrap integrates properly with other commands, handles existing project states correctly, and maintains data integrity throughout the workflow.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Integration Test Setup
- [ ] Create integration test file for bootstrap command
- [ ] Set up test workspace utilities
- [ ] Create helper functions for running CLI commands
- [ ] Set up test fixtures (sample master plans)

### Phase 2: CLI Integration Tests
- [ ] Test: `autoagent bootstrap` with empty project
- [ ] Test: `autoagent bootstrap` with existing issues
- [ ] Test: Command output and error handling
- [ ] Test: Exit codes and error messages

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration Tests
- [ ] Test: Bootstrap followed by status command
- [ ] Test: Bootstrap followed by list command
- [ ] Test: Multiple bootstrap operations
- [ ] Test: Bootstrap with different plan formats

### Phase 4: State Verification Tests
- [ ] Verify correct files created in issues/
- [ ] Verify correct files created in plans/
- [ ] Verify todo.md updates correctly
- [ ] Verify no data loss or corruption

## Technical Approach
- Use actual CLI execution for realistic testing
- Create temporary test workspaces
- Verify both command output and file system state
- Clean up test artifacts after each test

## Test Implementation Example
```typescript
describe('Bootstrap Command Integration', () => {
  let testWorkspace: string;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    testWorkspace = await createTestWorkspace();
  });

  afterEach(async () => {
    await cleanupTestWorkspace(testWorkspace);
  });

  it('should integrate with existing workflow', async () => {
    // Setup existing issues
    // Run bootstrap
    // Verify results
  });
});
```

## Potential Challenges
- Managing test workspace cleanup
- Ensuring tests don't interfere with each other
- Testing CLI output parsing
- Handling platform-specific differences

## Success Metrics
- Integration tests cover real-world scenarios
- Tests are reliable and not flaky
- Tests verify both behavior and state
- Tests run reasonably quickly
