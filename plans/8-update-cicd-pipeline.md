# Plan for Issue 8: Update CI/CD Pipeline for Vitest

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/8-update-cicd-pipeline.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Test Workflow
- [ ] Replace Jest commands with Vitest
- [ ] Update test job matrix
- [ ] Configure test reporters
- [ ] Set up test result artifacts

### Phase 2: Coverage Configuration
- [ ] Configure Vitest coverage output
- [ ] Update Codecov integration
- [ ] Set coverage format to lcov
- [ ] Add coverage threshold checks

### Phase 3: Add Test Jobs
- [ ] Create unit test job
- [ ] Add integration test job
- [ ] Set up E2E test job
- [ ] Configure job dependencies

### Phase 4: Performance Tracking
- [ ] Add benchmark job
- [ ] Store benchmark results
- [ ] Compare against baselines
- [ ] Add performance alerts

### Phase 5: Optimization
- [ ] Configure test parallelization
- [ ] Set up test caching
- [ ] Optimize job matrix
- [ ] Add conditional job execution

## Workflow Structure
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [18, 20, 22]
        suite: [unit, integration]
    
  e2e:
    needs: test
    
  benchmarks:
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    
  coverage:
    needs: test
```

## Technical Approach
- Gradual workflow updates
- Test each change in PR
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Monitor CI performance

## CI/CD Features
1. **Parallel Testing**: Matrix strategy for speed
2. **Coverage Reports**: Automated threshold checks
3. **Result Artifacts**: Test reports and coverage
4. **Performance Tracking**: Benchmark regression detection
5. **Conditional Execution**: Smart job triggering

## Potential Challenges
- Test flakiness in CI environment
- Coverage report format differences
- Benchmark stability in CI
- Action compatibility issues

## Success Metrics
- All tests passing in CI
- Coverage reports generated
- Benchmarks tracked over time
- CI execution time improved
