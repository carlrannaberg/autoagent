# Plan for Issue #19: Implement plan from fix-bootstrap-issue-numbering

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/1-implement-plan-from-fix-bootstrap-issue-numbering.md`.

## Overview

This plan focuses on analyzing and decomposing the master plan for fixing bootstrap issue numbering. The bootstrap command currently has issues with hardcoded issue numbers and TODO item handling that need to be addressed. This plan will break down the necessary fixes into manageable tasks to ensure the bootstrap command works correctly with dynamic issue numbering and proper TODO preservation.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze the master plan** - Review the fix-bootstrap-issue-numbering specification to understand all required fixes
2. **Identify core issues** - Document the specific problems with hardcoded values and TODO handling
3. **Decompose into tasks** - Break down the fixes into independent, implementable issues
4. **Create issue files** - Generate tracking issues for each identified fix
5. **Define test scenarios** - Establish clear testing criteria for bootstrap functionality
6. **Update tracking system** - Add all new issues to the project todo list
7. **Establish fix order** - Determine the logical sequence for implementing the fixes
