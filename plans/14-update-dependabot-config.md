# Plan for Issue #14: Update Dependabot Configuration

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to update Dependabot configuration for better dependency management.

## Overview

This plan focuses on optimizing the Dependabot configuration to reduce manual intervention while maintaining project stability. The goal is to implement a strategic approach to dependency updates that balances automation with control, using features like update grouping, version constraints, and selective auto-merge policies. This will streamline the dependency management process and reduce the burden of reviewing numerous individual PRs.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze current state** - Review existing Dependabot config and recent PR patterns
2. **Define update strategy** - Establish policies for major/minor/patch updates by dependency type
3. **Design grouping strategy** - Plan how to group related updates to reduce PR volume
4. **Configure version constraints** - Set up ignore rules for problematic updates (e.g., ESLint v9)
5. **Implement configuration** - Update `.github/dependabot.yml` with new rules and groups
6. **Set up labels and reviewers** - Configure PR metadata for better organization
7. **Document strategy** - Add clear documentation explaining the update approach
8. **Monitor and adjust** - Track effectiveness and refine configuration based on results

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis
- [ ] Review current Dependabot configuration
- [ ] Analyze recent Dependabot PRs and their impact
- [ ] Identify dependencies that frequently cause issues
- [ ] Research best practices for Dependabot configuration

### Phase 2: Strategy Definition
- [ ] Define update policies for different dependency types
- [ ] Decide on major version update handling
- [ ] Determine auto-merge policies
- [ ] Set up PR grouping strategies

### Phase 3: Configuration Updates
- [ ] Update `.github/dependabot.yml` with new rules
- [ ] Configure version constraints for critical dependencies
- [ ] Set up separate update groups if needed
- [ ] Add ignore rules for problematic updates
- [ ] Configure PR labels and reviewers

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] Document the update strategy in the repository
- [ ] Add comments to dependabot.yml explaining rules
- [ ] Update contributing guidelines if needed

### Phase 5: Testing and Monitoring
- [ ] Validate configuration syntax
- [ ] Monitor next set of Dependabot PRs
- [ ] Adjust configuration based on results
- [ ] Ensure security updates are not blocked

## Technical Approach
### Example Configuration Structure
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      # Group minor and patch updates
      minor-and-patch:
        patterns:
          - "*"
        update-types:
          - "minor"
          - "patch"
    # Handle major versions separately
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
    # Version constraints
    ignore:
      - dependency-name: "eslint"
        versions: ["9.x"]  # Temporarily ignore v9
    # Or use version constraints
    allow:
      - dependency-name: "*"
        dependency-type: "production"
```

## Update Strategy Options
### Option 1: Conservative Approach
- Pin major versions for critical tools
- Auto-merge only patch updates
- Manual review for minor updates

### Option 2: Grouped Updates
- Group all minor/patch updates
- Separate PRs for major updates
- Different merge policies per group

### Option 3: Selective Constraints
- Allow all updates except specific tools
- Maintain ignore list for problematic updates
- Regular review and adjustment

## Potential Challenges
- Balancing automation with stability
- Ensuring security updates are not delayed
- Managing the review burden
- Keeping configuration maintainable

## Success Metrics
- Reduced manual intervention for updates
- No build breaks from automated updates
- Security updates applied promptly
- Clear update strategy understood by team
