# Plan for Issue #2: Install and Configure Vitest

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/2-install-configure-vitest.md`.

## Overview

This plan covers the complete migration from Jest to Vitest as the testing framework for the AutoAgent project. The migration includes removing all Jest dependencies, installing Vitest and its associated packages, creating appropriate configuration files for different test types, and updating all package.json scripts to use Vitest commands.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Remove Jest Dependencies
- [ ] Back up current package.json
- [ ] Remove Jest packages: jest, @types/jest, ts-jest
- [ ] Clean node_modules and package-lock.json

### Phase 2: Install Vitest
- [ ] Install core Vitest packages
- [ ] Install UI and coverage packages
- [ ] Install testing utilities
- [ ] Verify installation

### Phase 3: Create Configuration Files
- [ ] Create vitest.config.ts with base configuration
- [ ] Create vitest.config.integration.ts for integration tests
- [ ] Create vitest.config.e2e.ts for E2E tests
- [ ] Set up path aliases matching tsconfig

### Phase 4: Update Package Scripts
- [ ] Replace Jest scripts with Vitest equivalents
- [ ] Add new Vitest-specific scripts (UI, bench, debug)
- [ ] Ensure script naming consistency

### Phase 5: Verification
- [ ] Run a simple test to verify setup
- [ ] Check coverage configuration works
- [ ] Verify path aliases resolve correctly

## Technical Approach
- Use configuration from master plan as reference
- Maintain compatibility with existing test structure
- Preserve coverage thresholds

## Potential Challenges
- Path alias resolution differences
- Coverage reporter compatibility
- Script parameter differences

## Success Metrics
- All Vitest packages installed successfully
- Configuration files created and valid
- Basic test execution works
- Coverage reporting functional
