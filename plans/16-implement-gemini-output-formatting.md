# Plan for Issue #16: Implement Gemini Output Formatting

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/16-implement-gemini-output-formatting.md`.

## Overview

This plan covers the implementation of improved output formatting for the Gemini provider to enhance readability. The core functionality involves adding intelligent line breaks at sentence boundaries in the streaming output and providing visual formatting similar to Claude's output style. This will make Gemini's responses more readable by preventing long, unbroken blocks of text.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Implement text processing logic** - Add sentence boundary detection and line break insertion to `StreamFormatter`
2. **Update GeminiProvider** - Integrate the formatting logic into the streaming method
3. **Handle stream buffering** - Ensure partial sentences are properly buffered across chunks
4. **Add visual formatting** - Implement header/footer styling similar to Claude's output
5. **Test edge cases** - Verify handling of abbreviations, numbers, and special punctuation
6. **Validate streaming behavior** - Ensure formatting doesn't break real-time output streaming
7. **Optimize performance** - Keep formatting logic simple to avoid impacting stream performance

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation
- [ ] Add line break logic to `StreamFormatter`.
- [ ] Update `GeminiProvider` streaming method.
- [ ] Add header/footer formatting.

## Technical Approach
As described in the `gemini-output-formatting.md` specification, the approach involves:
1.  **Text Processing**: Add line breaks at sentence boundaries.
2.  **Visual Formatting**: Add a header/footer similar to Claude's.
3.  **Stream Handling**: Process text chunks and format in real-time.
4.  **Simple Implementation**: No complex parsing, just text formatting.

## Potential Challenges
- Handling partial sentences in the stream buffer.
- Ensuring the regex for sentence splitting is robust enough for common cases.
