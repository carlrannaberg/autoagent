# Plan for Issue 16: Implement Gemini Output Formatting

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/16-implement-gemini-output-formatting.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation
- [ ] Add line break logic to `StreamFormatter`.
- [ ] Update `GeminiProvider` streaming method.
- [ ] Add header/footer formatting.

## Technical Approach
As described in the `gemini-output-formatting.md` specification, the approach involves:
1.  **Text Processing**: Add line breaks at sentence boundaries.
2.  **Visual Formatting**: Add a header/footer similar to Claude's.
3.  **Stream Handling**: Process text chunks and format in real-time.
4.  **Simple Implementation**: No complex parsing, just text formatting.

## Potential Challenges
- Handling partial sentences in the stream buffer.
- Ensuring the regex for sentence splitting is robust enough for common cases.
