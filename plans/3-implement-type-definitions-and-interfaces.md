# Plan for Issue 3: Implement type definitions and interfaces

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/3-implement-type-definitions-and-interfaces.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Data Types
- [ ] Create Issue interface with all required fields
- [ ] Create Plan interface with Phase support
- [ ] Define Phase interface for implementation steps
- [ ] Add proper imports and exports

### Phase 2: Execution Types
- [ ] Implement ExecutionResult interface
- [ ] Add RollbackData interface
- [ ] Create ProgressCallback type
- [ ] Define provider type literals

### Phase 3: Configuration Types
- [ ] Create AgentConfig interface with all options
- [ ] Create UserConfig interface for settings
- [ ] Add configuration type guards if needed
- [ ] Include signal and callback types

### Phase 4: Additional Types
- [ ] Define AgentEvent type union
- [ ] Create Status interface
- [ ] Add any utility types needed
- [ ] Ensure all exports are properly organized

## Technical Approach
- Single index.ts file for all types
- Use interface over type where appropriate
- Include optional fields with ? operator
- Add JSDoc comments for complex types

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring backward compatibility
- Avoiding circular dependencies
- Maintaining type safety with provider names

## Success Metrics
- All types from master plan are implemented
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Types are properly exported
- Documentation is clear
