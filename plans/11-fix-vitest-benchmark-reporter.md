# Plan for Issue #11: Fix Vitest Benchmark Reporter Configuration

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to fix the Vitest benchmark reporter configuration issue.

## Overview

This plan addresses the issue where the `npm run bench` command fails due to an unrecognized `--reporter=json` flag in Vitest's benchmark mode. The solution involves investigating the current configuration, evaluating reporter options compatible with Vitest benchmarks, and implementing a fix that maintains compatibility with the GitHub workflow while ensuring benchmark results are properly stored and accessible.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Investigate current configuration** - Examine benchmark setup in `vitest.bench.config.ts`, `package.json`, and GitHub workflows
2. **Research reporter options** - Identify available and compatible reporter options for Vitest benchmarks
3. **Select optimal solution** - Choose between default reporter, custom reporter, or third-party reporter based on requirements
4. **Update configuration files** - Modify benchmark command, Vitest config, and GitHub workflow as needed
5. **Test locally** - Verify benchmarks run successfully with the new configuration
6. **Validate CI/CD integration** - Ensure GitHub workflow processes benchmark results correctly
7. **Verify storage compatibility** - Confirm benchmark results maintain format compatibility with existing storage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis
- [ ] Examine current benchmark configuration in `vitest.bench.config.ts`
- [ ] Review npm script in `package.json` for `bench` command
- [ ] Check GitHub workflow configuration for benchmark job
- [ ] Research Vitest benchmark reporter options

### Phase 2: Solution Selection
- [ ] Evaluate available reporter options for Vitest benchmarks
- [ ] Determine if custom reporter is needed
- [ ] Choose approach that maintains compatibility with GitHub workflow

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Update benchmark command in `package.json`
- [ ] Modify `vitest.bench.config.ts` if needed
- [ ] Update GitHub workflow to handle new output format
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing benchmark storage

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Run benchmarks locally with new configuration
- [ ] Test GitHub workflow with the changes
- [ ] Verify benchmark results are properly stored
- [ ] Ensure all CI/CD checks pass

## Technical Approach
### Option 1: Use Default Reporter
- Remove `--reporter=json` flag
- Update workflow to parse default output

### Option 2: Custom Reporter
- Create a custom reporter that outputs JSON
- Register it in Vitest configuration

### Option 3: Third-party Reporter
- Research and install a compatible JSON reporter
- Configure it properly in the benchmark config

## Potential Challenges
- Maintaining compatibility with existing benchmark storage format
- Ensuring the solution works in both local and CI environments
- Handling different output formats between Vitest versions

## Success Metrics
- `npm run bench` executes without errors
- CI/CD pipeline Performance Benchmarks job passes
- Benchmark results are stored and accessible in GitHub
- No regression in other parts of the build process
