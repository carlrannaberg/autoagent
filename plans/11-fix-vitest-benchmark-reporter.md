# Plan for Issue 11: Fix Vitest Benchmark Reporter Configuration

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to fix the Vitest benchmark reporter configuration issue.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis
- [ ] Examine current benchmark configuration in `vitest.bench.config.ts`
- [ ] Review npm script in `package.json` for `bench` command
- [ ] Check GitHub workflow configuration for benchmark job
- [ ] Research Vitest benchmark reporter options

### Phase 2: Solution Selection
- [ ] Evaluate available reporter options for Vitest benchmarks
- [ ] Determine if custom reporter is needed
- [ ] Choose approach that maintains compatibility with GitHub workflow

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Update benchmark command in `package.json`
- [ ] Modify `vitest.bench.config.ts` if needed
- [ ] Update GitHub workflow to handle new output format
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing benchmark storage

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Run benchmarks locally with new configuration
- [ ] Test GitHub workflow with the changes
- [ ] Verify benchmark results are properly stored
- [ ] Ensure all CI/CD checks pass

## Technical Approach
### Option 1: Use Default Reporter
- Remove `--reporter=json` flag
- Update workflow to parse default output

### Option 2: Custom Reporter
- Create a custom reporter that outputs JSON
- Register it in Vitest configuration

### Option 3: Third-party Reporter
- Research and install a compatible JSON reporter
- Configure it properly in the benchmark config

## Potential Challenges
- Maintaining compatibility with existing benchmark storage format
- Ensuring the solution works in both local and CI environments
- Handling different output formats between Vitest versions

## Success Metrics
- `npm run bench` executes without errors
- CI/CD pipeline Performance Benchmarks job passes
- Benchmark results are stored and accessible in GitHub
- No regression in other parts of the build process
