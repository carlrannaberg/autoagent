# Plan for Issue 7: Implement autonomous agent with failover logic

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/7-implement-autonomous-agent-with-failover-logic.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Class Setup
- [ ] Create AutonomousAgent class
- [ ] Initialize with dependencies (FileManager, ConfigManager)
- [ ] Set up EventEmitter for internal events
- [ ] Configure constructor with AgentConfig

### Phase 2: Provider Management
- [ ] Implement getAvailableProvider method
- [ ] Add provider failover logic
- [ ] Handle rate limit detection
- [ ] Implement retry with backoff

### Phase 3: Issue Execution
- [ ] Implement executeIssue method
- [ ] Add progress tracking support
- [ ] Handle dry-run mode
- [ ] Integrate provider execution

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement executeAll for batch processing
- [ ] Add git auto-commit functionality
- [ ] Update provider instruction files
- [ ] Support cancellation via AbortSignal

## Technical Approach
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement robust error handling
- Support async/await patterns
- Use events for loose coupling

## Potential Challenges
- Complex failover state management
- Progress tracking accuracy
- Git operation error handling
- Cancellation cleanup

## Success Metrics
- All execution modes work correctly
- Failover happens seamlessly
- Progress is reported accurately
- Git operations are safe
