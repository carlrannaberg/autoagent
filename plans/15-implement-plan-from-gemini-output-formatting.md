# Plan for Issue #15: Implement plan from gemini-output-formatting

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/1-implement-plan-from-gemini-output-formatting.md`.

## Overview

This plan focuses on analyzing and decomposing the master plan from the gemini-output-formatting specification. Similar to #10, this involves breaking down a comprehensive plan into manageable, trackable issues. The goal is to ensure the Gemini output formatting improvements are implemented systematically with proper task decomposition and dependency management.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze the master plan** - Review the gemini-output-formatting specification to understand all formatting requirements
2. **Identify discrete tasks** - Break down the formatting improvements into independent implementation units
3. **Create tracking issues** - Generate individual issue files for each identified task
4. **Define acceptance criteria** - Ensure each issue has clear, testable completion criteria
5. **Update project tracking** - Add all new issues to the todo management system
6. **Validate dependencies** - Check that issues can be worked on independently or document dependencies
7. **Prioritize implementation** - Establish a logical order for tackling the formatting improvements
