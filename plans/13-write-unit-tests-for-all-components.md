# Plan for Issue 13: Write unit tests for all components

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/13-write-unit-tests-for-all-components.md`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up test file structure
- [ ] Configure Jest mocks
- [ ] Create test utilities
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Core Component Tests
- [ ] Test AutonomousAgent class
- [ ] Test provider implementations
- [ ] Test FileManager operations
- [ ] Test ConfigManager functionality

### Phase 3: Utility Tests
- [ ] Test logger functions
- [ ] Test retry logic
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test edge cases

### Phase 4: Integration Tests
- [ ] Test component interactions
- [ ] Test CLI commands
- [ ] Test end-to-end flows
- [ ] Verify coverage targets

## Technical Approach
- Use Jest mock functions
- Test async code with async/await
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on behavior, not implementation

## Potential Challenges
- Mocking file system operations
- Testing CLI interactions
- Async test complexity
- Achieving coverage targets

## Success Metrics
- All tests pass reliably
- Coverage exceeds 80%
- Tests are maintainable
- Edge cases are covered
