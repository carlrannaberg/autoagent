# Feature: Distributed Event Processing Pipeline

## Requirement
Design and implement a scalable event processing pipeline that can handle millions of events per day with real-time processing, filtering, transformation, and routing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Events are ingested from multiple sources (Kafka, HTTP, WebSocket)
- Real-time event filtering based on configurable rules
- Event transformation with custom processors
- Dynamic routing to multiple destinations
- Event replay and reprocessing capabilities
- Dead letter queue for failed events
- Monitoring and alerting integration
- Schema registry for event validation

## Technical Details
- Apache Kafka for event streaming
- Apache Flink for stream processing
- Schema registry with Avro/Protobuf support
- Redis for caching and state management
- Elasticsearch for event storage and search
- Grafana dashboards for monitoring
- Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Process 100k events per second
- End-to-end latency < 100ms
- 99.99% availability
- Zero data loss guarantee
- GDPR compliance for PII handling

## Security Requirements
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive events
- API key authentication for producers
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for all operations
