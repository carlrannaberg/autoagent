### Data Pipeline Architecture
```
Raw Data → Ingestion → Validation → Transformation → Storage → Analytics → Visualization
                ↓                          ↓                        ↓
           Dead Letter              Quality Metrics            ML Pipeline
               Queue                   Monitoring               Training
```

### Security & Compliance
- **Data Security**
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Field-level encryption for PII
  - Data masking and anonymization
  - Audit logging for all data access
  
- **Access Control**
  - Row-level security
  - Column-level permissions
  - Multi-tenant isolation
  - SSO integration

### Performance Requirements
- **Ingestion**
  - 1 million events/second sustained
  - < 100ms end-to-end latency
  - 99.99% availability
  
- **Query Performance**
  - Sub-second response for real-time queries
  - < 5 seconds for complex analytical queries
  - Concurrent query handling (1000+ users)

### Scalability Design
- **Horizontal Scaling**
  - Microservices architecture
  - Service mesh (Istio)
  - Database sharding
  - Distributed caching
  
- **Vertical Scaling**
  - Resource optimization algorithms
  - Workload-specific node pools
  - Automatic resource allocation

## Implementation Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Go (high-performance services), Python (analytics), TypeScript (frontend)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Elasticsearch, Redis
- **Streaming**: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink
- **Container**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI, ArgoCD

### Development Methodology
- **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure and ingestion pipeline
- **Phase 2**: Storage layer and basic analytics
- **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics and ML integration
- **Phase 4**: Visualization and reporting
- **Phase 5**: Enterprise features (multi-tenancy, advanced security)

### Quality Assurance
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Unit tests with 80% coverage minimum
  - Integration tests for all data pipelines
  - Performance testing with production-like loads
  - Chaos engineering for resilience testing
  
- **Monitoring**
  - Application performance monitoring
  - Business metrics dashboards
  - Alerting for SLA violations
  - Capacity planning metrics

## Success Criteria
