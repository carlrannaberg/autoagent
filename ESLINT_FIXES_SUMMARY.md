# ESLint Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **Removed unused imports**:
   - Removed `chalk` import from `src/cli/index.ts`
   - Removed `chalk` import from `src/core/autonomous-agent.ts`
   - Removed `chalk` imports from provider files

2. **Fixed strict-boolean-expressions**:
   - Replaced `||` with `??` for nullable values
   - Added explicit checks for undefined/empty strings
   - Fixed conditional expressions with proper null/undefined checks

3. **Fixed template literal expressions**:
   - Replaced object interpolations with proper string conversions
   - Used nullish coalescing for optional values

4. **Fixed type safety in tests**:
   - Replaced `any` with proper types in test mocks
   - Used `unknown as` pattern for type assertions
   - Fixed unsafe assignments and arguments

5. **Fixed non-null assertions**:
   - Replaced `!` with proper null checks
   - Used nullish coalescing operator

6. **Removed async from non-async functions**:
   - Fixed `extractOrInitializeMetrics` in provider-learning.ts
   - Fixed `analyzeFileChanges` in provider-learning.ts

## Remaining Issues (123 errors)

### Critical Issues:
1. **Unbound methods in tests** (~50+ errors):
   - Test expectations using `.toHaveBeenCalled()` need proper binding
   - Can be fixed by wrapping in arrow functions or using `.bind()`

2. **Console statements** (~10+ warnings):
   - Some console.log statements remain in test utilities
   - Logger class intentionally uses console (this is correct)

3. **Strict boolean expressions** (~20+ errors):
   - Some complex conditionals still need explicit null checks
   - Mostly in test files and utility functions

4. **Type safety in tests** (~10+ errors):
   - Some test mocks still use `any` type
   - Process.exit mock needs proper typing

### Recommendations:

1. **For unbound methods**: Add `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/unbound-method` comments for test expectations, as these are false positives in Jest tests.

2. **For console statements**: Add `// eslint-disable-next-line no-console` for intentional console usage in Logger class and debugging utilities.

3. **For remaining strict-boolean-expressions**: Continue adding explicit null/undefined checks where needed.

4. **Consider updating ESLint config** to be less strict for test files:
   - Disable `@typescript-eslint/unbound-method` for test files
   - Allow `any` types in test mocks
   - Allow console statements in specific directories

The codebase is now significantly cleaner with proper type safety and null handling. The remaining issues are mostly in test files and can be addressed with targeted fixes or ESLint configuration adjustments.
